description: From our first trip to New Zealand Jerad was convinced he had found a place he could comfortably call home and start a new life without his past washing back up at the most inconvenient time. <br><br>Tripping in the dinosaur maze to find there way back to the appartment was Jerad's first adventure in this new country.
